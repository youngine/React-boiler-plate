# React-boiler-plate

### Getting Started
The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

### How to run the project
- make dev.js file inside config folder
- put mongoDB info into dev.js file
- Type " npm install " inside the root directory ( Download Server Dependencies )
- Type " npm install " inside the client directory ( Download Front-end Dependencies )
